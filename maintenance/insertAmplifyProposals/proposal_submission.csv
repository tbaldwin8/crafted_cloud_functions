I'll take viewers on a quick and engaging journey from unboxing the product to serving up a beautifully plated meal. Think vibrant close-ups of a pan-seared salmon filet sizzling in a cast iron skillet, perfectly golden on the outside and juicy inside. I'll drizzle a tangy honey-mustard glaze over the top and pair it with crisp garlic green beans and fluffy lemon-butter rice.

To keep the energy high, I’ll use punchy on-screen text, ASMR cooking sounds, and upbeat music. I'll also highlight a Publix call-to-action, guiding viewers to find Crafted's salmon for their next quick yet elevated dinner."
